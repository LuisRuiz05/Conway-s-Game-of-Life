# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

To run the program, you can take one of the input files and change the name to input.txt, or create a new one with the following specifications:
100 100 #width, heigth
200 #number of generations to simulate
45 54 #new cell position (write as much as you wish)
...

If the input.txt file does not exist, the program will not run.

If the grid is very big, the simulation will run kind of slow, so if you'd like a better performance, feel free to comment line 262-288, but the pattern
recognizer will not work.
